# CIFAR-10 Datast Classification by Deep Learning

An image classifier using deep learning (PyTorch) on the CIFAR-10 dataset, featuring data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and visualization with Python machine learning libraries.

I use convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification.
